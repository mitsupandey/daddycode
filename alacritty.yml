# Key bindings
#
# Each binding is defined as an object with some properties. Most of the
# properties are optional. All of the alphabetical keys should have a letter for
# the `key` value such as `V`. Function keys are probably what you would expect
# as well (F1, F2, ..). The number keys above the main keyboard are encoded as
# `Key1`, `Key2`, etc. Keys on the number pad are encoded `Number1`, `Number2`,
# etc.  These all match the glutin::VirtualKeyCode variants.
#
# Possible values for `mods`
# `Command`, `Super` refer to the super/command/windows key
# `Control` for the control key
# `Shift` for the Shift key
# `Alt` and `Option` refer to alt/option
#
# mods may be combined with a `|`. For example, requiring control and shift
# looks like:
#
# mods: Control|Shift
#
# The parser is currently quite sensitive to whitespace and capitalization -
# capitalization must match exactly, and piped items must not have whitespace
# around them.
#
# Either an `action` or `chars` field must be present. `chars` writes the
# specified string every time that binding is activated. These should generally
# be escape sequences, but they can be configured to send arbitrary strings of
# bytes. Possible values of `action` include `Paste` and `PasteSelection`.
